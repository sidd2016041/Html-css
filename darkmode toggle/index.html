        <h1>Message to my Best-friend</h1>
        <p>I love you beyond the stars, my adorable friend. 
            I feel so blessed to have a friend like you. I never thought angels could exist in this world,
             but here you are in the flesh. Your friendship is so precious to me that I wouldn't trade it for 
             anything in the world, not even a million bucks!</p>
